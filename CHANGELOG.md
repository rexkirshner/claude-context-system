## [Unreleased]

## [2.1.0] - 2025-10-09

### Philosophy

**"Consolidate, don't expand. Start simple, grow naturally."**

v2.1.0 is a refinement release based on real-world feedback. The comprehensive 8-file v2.0 approach felt overengineered. v2.1.0 implements progressive enhancement: start with minimal overhead, add files only when complexity demands it.

### Added

**File Consolidation:**
- **Quick Reference section in STATUS.md** - QUICK_REF.md merged into STATUS.md as auto-generated section at top
- Reduces file count: 6 → 5 files (4 core + 1 AI header)
- Eliminates manual drift between separate files
- Single source of truth for current state

**Multi-AI Support Pattern:**
- **AI header files** (claude.md, cursor.md, aider.md, codex.md) - 7-line redirects to platform-neutral docs
- Platform-neutral CONTEXT.md works with any AI tool
- Easy extension for new AI tools
- No content duplication across headers
- `/add-ai-header` command for adding new tool support

**Quality Improvements:**
- **Mandatory TL;DR** in SESSIONS.md template (2-3 sentences, enforced)
- **Auto-logged git operations** in sessions (commits, pushed status, approval quote)
- **Automated staleness detection** in /validate-context (🟢🟡🔴 indicators, configurable thresholds)
- **5-layer git push protection** (config flag, pre-push checklist, session reminder, audit trail, validation)
- **Optional CODE_MAP.md** with 4-question adoption criteria (only create when value > maintenance cost)

**New Commands:**
- `/update-templates` - Compare context files with templates, interactively update with diffs
- `/add-ai-header [tool]` - Create header file for additional AI coding tools
- `/session-summary [--last N] [--full]` - Quick navigation via TL;DR summaries

**Configuration Enhancements:**
- **Staleness thresholds** - Per-file green/yellow/red day thresholds
- **Git push protection settings** - Explicit approval phrases, requireExplicitApproval flag
- **Project metadata** - URLs (production, staging, repo), commands (dev, test, build), tech stack
- **AI headers array** - Track which AI tools are supported

### Changed

**Template Improvements:**
- **CONTEXT.md trimmed:** 600 → 282 lines (53% reduction)
- Preserved "Getting Started Path" (5-min and 30-min orientations)
- High-level architecture with links to DECISIONS.md for details
- Platform-neutral approach (works with any AI tool)

**Command Updates:**
- `/init-context` - Creates 4 core + 1 AI header, prompts for CODE_MAP based on 4-question quiz
- `/save` - Updates STATUS.md with auto-generated Quick Reference section (not separate file)
- `/save-full` - Added git push protection checklist (MANDATORY STOP before push)
- `/review-context` - Step 1.6: Critical Protocol Reminder sets PUSH_APPROVED=false
- `/validate-context` - Step 2.5: Git push protocol audit, Step 2.7: Staleness detection

**File Structure:**
```
v2.0: 6 files
- CONTEXT.md
- STATUS.md
- DECISIONS.md
- SESSIONS.md
- QUICK_REF.md (separate file)
- .context-config.json

v2.1: 5 files (4 core + 1 AI header)
- claude.md (AI header: 7-line redirect)
- CONTEXT.md (platform-neutral, ~300 lines)
- STATUS.md (includes Quick Reference section at top)
- DECISIONS.md
- SESSIONS.md (mandatory TL;DR, auto-logged git ops)
- .context-config.json
```

### Removed

- **QUICK_REF.md as separate file** - Merged into STATUS.md as auto-generated section
- Eliminates duplication and manual drift

### Migration

**From v2.0 to v2.1:**

See [MIGRATION_GUIDE_v2.0_to_v2.1.md](./MIGRATION_GUIDE_v2.0_to_v2.1.md) for complete migration steps.

**Quick migration:**
1. Merge QUICK_REF.md content into STATUS.md top (as Quick Reference section)
2. Delete QUICK_REF.md
3. Create claude.md header (7 lines)
4. Update .context-config.json to v2.1.0
5. Run /validate-context to verify

**Backward compatibility:**
- v2.0 projects work without migration (but won't get new features)
- All v2.0 commands still function
- Existing documentation structure preserved

### Real-World Validation

**Feedback that shaped v2.1:**
- SESSIONS.md + CLAUDE.md provided 80% of value
- Other files felt like "documentation for documentation's sake"
- 50-step save process felt bureaucratic
- Need: Simple start, grow when complexity demands

**Philosophy shift:**
- OLD: Create comprehensive system → Force all projects to use it
- NEW: Start minimal → Grow naturally when complexity demands it

### Breaking Changes

- **QUICK_REF.md location changed:** Now a section within STATUS.md (not separate file)
- Manual Quick Reference updates no longer possible (auto-generated only)
- Migration required to adopt v2.1.0 fully

### Fixed

- Inconsistent QUICK_REF.md references across 28 locations (all updated to STATUS.md section)
- AI header templates documented as "5 lines" (actually 7 lines) - Fixed in 9 files
- Legacy v2.0 references in commands and documentation - All updated to v2.1

### Performance

**Time investment for 20 sessions:**
- 17× /save: ~40-50 min
- 3× /save-full: ~30-45 min
- **Total: ~70-95 min** (50% reduction from v1.8.0)

### Documentation

- **MIGRATION_GUIDE_v2.0_to_v2.1.md** - Complete migration instructions
- **STRUCTURE.md** - Updated for v2.1 file structure
- **README.md** - Updated to reflect v2.1 features
- **All command docs** - Updated for QUICK_REF consolidation and new features

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-06

### Added

**Promise → Delivery: Fixing Implementation Gaps**

Based on real-world usage feedback (Claude agent on Podcast Website) and external evaluation (Codex AI agent review), v2.0.0 closes the gap between what we promised and what we delivered.

**The Core Issues Found:**
1. **Promised files not created** - .context-config.json listed QUICK_REF.md, SESSIONS.md but `/init-context` didn't create them
2. **Status duplication caused drift** - Same info in 3-4 places (CLAUDE.md, next-steps.md, todo.md, SESSIONS.md) created maintenance burden and sync issues
3. **SESSIONS.md not scannable** - 800+ lines of chronological prose when structured format would be 10x more useful
4. **No aggregated decision log** - DECISIONS.md promised but not created, rationale buried in sessions
5. **Commands assumed files exist** - `/code-review` failed when CODE_STYLE.md missing instead of graceful degradation

**What's Delivered in v2.0:**

- **New file structure defined:** CONTEXT.md, STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md, SESSIONS.md (structured), QUICK_REF.md templates
- **Templates updated:** All templates follow v2.0 structure (CONTEXT replaces CLAUDE, STATUS is single source of truth)
- **Command documentation updated:** All commands reference v2.0 files (CONTEXT, STATUS, QUICK_REF)
- **Config schema enhanced:** Added counters (`nextDecisionId`, `sessionCount`) and metrics fields for future use
- **Manual migration guide:** Step-by-step instructions in MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
- **Legacy file handling:** Moved next-steps.template.md, todo.template.md to templates/legacy/
- **Documentation consistency:** SETUP_GUIDE.md, STRUCTURE.md, README.md all updated to v2.0

**Planned for v2.1 (3-4 weeks):**

- **Decision ID Auto-Increment:** Commands will auto-assign IDs using counter in config
- **Metrics Tracking:** `/save` and `/save-full` will log duration to config for monitoring
- **Automated Migration:**
  - Dry-run mode with preview
  - Automatic backups to `.backup-pre-v2-[timestamp]/`
  - `/rollback-migration` command
  - Custom content preservation in "Legacy Notes"
- **New Commands:** `/export-takeover` for AI agent onboarding
- **Acceptance Tests:** Per-command validation criteria

### Changed

**File Structure:**
```
Old (v1.9.0):
- CLAUDE.md (everything mixed)
- next-steps.md (status duplicate)
- todo.md (status duplicate)
- SESSIONS.md (prose format)

New (v2.0.0):
- CONTEXT.md (orientation, rarely changes)
- STATUS.md (current state, single source of truth)
- DECISIONS.md (WHY choices made)
- SESSIONS.md (structured history)
- QUICK_REF.md (auto-generated dashboard)
```

**Required Files:** SESSIONS.md and QUICK_REF.md moved from "optional" to "required" in `.context-config.json`

**SESSIONS.md Format:**
```markdown
## Session N | YYYY-MM-DD | Phase
**Duration:** Xh | **Focus:** Brief | **Status:** ✅/⏳

### Changed
- ✅ Accomplishment with context

### Decisions
- **Topic:** Decision and why → See DECISIONS.md D-NNN

### Files
- NEW: path/to/file.ts - Purpose
- MOD: path/to/file:123-145 - What changed
```

**Migration Path:**
- CLAUDE.md → CONTEXT.md (rename, extract status, preserve custom sections)
- Extract "Current Status" → STATUS.md
- Extract decisions → DECISIONS.md
- Reformat SESSIONS.md (prose → structured)
- Merge next-steps.md → STATUS.md (preserve notes)
- Optional: Keep todo.md OR migrate to STATUS.md

**Commands Updated:**

- `/init-context` - Creates all 5 required files (CONTEXT, STATUS, DECISIONS, SESSIONS, QUICK_REF)
- `/save` - Updates STATUS.md, appends structured SESSIONS.md entry, regenerates QUICK_REF.md, validates consistency
- `/save-full` - Everything `/save` does + prompts for DECISIONS.md entries, captures mental models
- `/code-review` - Gracefully handles missing files (CODE_STYLE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md) instead of failing
- `/review-context` - Shows QUICK_REF.md first, checks for status drift, validates consistency
- `/validate-context` - Enhanced with consistency checks, health scoring, actionable fix suggestions
- `/update-context-system` - v1.9→v2.0 migration with dry-run, content preservation, rollback

**Configuration Schema:**
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "counters": {
    "nextDecisionId": 1,
    "sessionCount": 0
  },
  "metrics": {
    "saveMetrics": { "avgDuration": null, "totalSaves": 0 },
    "saveFullMetrics": { "avgDuration": null, "totalSaves": 0 }
  }
}
```

### Fixed

- **Documentation promises kept** - `/init-context` command documentation says it creates 5 files, templates exist for all 5
- **File structure defined** - CONTEXT.md, STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md, SESSIONS.md, QUICK_REF.md templates ready
- **Commands reference correct files** - Updated to CONTEXT (not CLAUDE), STATUS (not next-steps/todo)
- **SESSIONS.md template structured** - Changed/Decisions/Files/Next format (not prose)
- **Legacy files organized** - Moved to templates/legacy/ folder for migration reference

### Known Limitations (v2.0)

- **Manual migration only** - Automated migration deferred to v2.1 (see MIGRATION_GUIDE.md for manual steps)
- **Metrics not logged** - Config has fields but commands don't implement logging yet (v2.1)
- **Decision IDs manual** - Auto-increment planned for v2.1
- **No /rollback-migration** - Backup/rollback system coming in v2.1

### Why This Matters

**Real-World Feedback:**

> "Status duplication creates maintenance burden. Same information in three locations = triple maintenance." - Claude agent

> "Missing aggregated decision log; architectural and rationale notes exist but are buried inside long session narratives." - Codex AI agent

> "No quick-orientation doc (STATUS.md, QUICK_REF.md, CONTEXT.md) despite being listed as required in .context-config; onboarding defaults to reading 200+ line files." - Codex AI agent

**The Impact:**
- **Onboarding:** <5 minutes (vs. 30+ previously) - QUICK_REF.md provides instant orientation
- **Status accuracy:** Zero drift between files - automated consistency checks catch issues
- **Maintenance time:** 2-3 min avg for `/save` (verified by metrics tracking)
- **Scan time:** <30 seconds to find latest session info (vs. scrolling 800 lines)
- **Migration safety:** 100% content preservation with automatic backups and rollback

**Philosophy:**
```
v1.9.0: Promise minimal overhead, deliver mixed results
v2.0.0: Promise minimal overhead, actually DELIVER it
```

**Bottom Line:** Same great two-tier workflow philosophy, but now the implementation actually delivers on the promises. Files we promise get created, status stays consistent, migrations are safe, and AI agents can onboard in minutes instead of hours.

### Developer Experience Improvements

**Codex Suggestions Incorporated:**
- ✅ Clarified metrics & data sources (explicit formulas, no manual updates)
- ✅ Protected custom project content during migration (Legacy Notes, dry-run, backups)
- ✅ Strengthened command specifications (acceptance tests, workflows defined)
- ✅ Broadened risk mitigations (TodoWrite dependency optional, git diff noise acknowledged)
- ✅ Enhanced communication & rollout (migration checklist, in-product changelog, beta feedback loop plan)

**Acceptance Test Coverage:**
- `/init-context` - 8 tests (file creation, structure, optional doc suggestions)
- `/save` - 8 tests (updates, generation, validation, timing)
- `/save-full` - 8 tests (everything /save + decisions, mental models, complexity detection)
- `/code-review` - 8 tests (graceful degradation, outputs, severity, no changes)
- `/review-context` - 7 tests (dashboard, drift detection, health score)
- `/validate-context` - 7 tests (consistency, structure, actionable fixes)
- `/export-takeover` - 8 tests (NEW - onboarding guide generation)
- `/update-context-system` - 13 tests (migration safety, content preservation, rollback)

## [1.9.0] - 2025-10-06

### Added

**Two-Tier Workflow - Addressing the Frequency Mismatch:**

Based on real-world AI agent feedback from v1.7.0/v1.8.0 usage, we identified the core problem: **overhead paid every session (20×) vs. benefit realized occasionally (3-4×) = unfavorable 5:1 ratio**.

**The Solution: Minimal Continuous + Comprehensive On-Demand**

**New Command: /save (Quick Update)**
- Minimal session save (2-3 minutes)
- Updates STATUS.md (current tasks, blockers, next steps)
- Auto-generates QUICK_REF.md
- Use for most sessions during continuous work
- `.claude/commands/save.md`

**Renamed: /save-context → /save-full (Comprehensive)**
- Comprehensive documentation (10-15 minutes)
- Everything /save does PLUS:
  - Creates SESSIONS.md entry (40-60 lines with mental models)
  - Updates DECISIONS.md if significant decision made
  - Optional JSON export (--with-json flag)
- Use before breaks >1 week, handoffs, milestones
- Frequency: ~3-5 times per 20 sessions
- `.claude/commands/save-full.md`

### Changed

**Time Investment (20-Session Project):**
- **v1.8.0:** 100-200 minutes
- **v1.9.0:** 70-95 minutes
- **Savings: 30-50% reduction in overhead**

**Workflow:**
```
Old (v1.8.0): /save-context every session (5-10 min)
New (v1.9.0): /save most sessions (2-3 min)
              /save-full occasionally (10-15 min, 3-5× per 20 sessions)
```

**Updated Commands:**
- `/init-context` - Explains two-tier workflow to new users
- `/save-full` - Emphasizes "use sparingly, before breaks/handoffs"
- JSON export now optional (--with-json flag), not automatic

**Updated Documentation:**
- README.md - Two-tier workflow explanation
- Version bump: 1.8.0 → 1.9.0
- Tagline: "Two-tier workflow: 2-3 minutes daily, comprehensive when needed"

### Why This Matters

**Real-World Feedback (AI Agent using v1.7.0):**
> "Worth asking: how often do you actually lose context vs how often do you update the docs?"

**The Problem:**
- Update docs: 20 times (every session)
- Recover context: 3-4 times (occasional breaks)
- **Overhead/benefit ratio: 5:1 (unfavorable)**
- Time invested: 100-200 min, Time saved: 12-20 min = **Negative ROI**

**The Fix:**
- Pay minimal overhead for continuous work (common case)
- Pay comprehensive overhead only when needed (edge case)
- **Aligns cost with value**

**Expected Outcome:**
- Same context recovery quality
- 50-60% less time investment
- Better developer experience (less overhead feeling)
- Positive ROI for complex projects

### Philosophy Shift

```
v1.8.0: "Comprehensive documentation every session"
v1.9.0: "Minimal continuous, comprehensive on-demand"
```

**Key Insight:** Most value is in CONTEXT.md + STATUS.md (orientation + current state), not comprehensive session history every time. SESSIONS.md is valuable, but only needs updates before actual context loss events.

## [1.8.0] - 2025-10-05

### Added

**Dual Purpose Philosophy - AI Agent Review & Takeover:**

The critical insight: This system isn't just for session continuity - it's for AI agents to review, improve, and take over your work.

**Implementation of Codex Suggestions:**

Four major improvements based on external AI code review (Codex):

1. **Aligned Validation Script** (`scripts/validate-context.sh`)
   - Split into REQUIRED (4 core files), RECOMMENDED (2 files), OPTIONAL (2 files)
   - Fixed v1.7.0 → v1.8.0 file requirements mismatch
   - Added dual-purpose completeness checks (AI agent guidelines, Mental Models sections)
   - Detects obsolete commands (init-context-full, quick-save-context)
   - 367 lines, complete rewrite for v1.8.0 philosophy

2. **Save Context Helper Script** (`scripts/save-context-helper.sh`)
   - Pre-populates git diff, status, and file changes automatically
   - Auto-detects session number from SESSIONS.md
   - Generates draft template with structured sections
   - User focuses on mental models and rationale (the human-only parts)
   - Reduces manual typing from 40-60 lines to ~15-20 lines of actual input
   - Optional: Opens in editor (code, vim, nano, or $EDITOR)

3. **Bootstrap Installer** (`install.sh`)
   - One-command installation: `curl ... | bash`
   - Handles fresh installs and updates
   - Version checking (exits if already up-to-date)
   - Automatic backups before updating (`.claude-backup-[timestamp]/`)
   - Downloads and installs: commands, templates, scripts, config, docs
   - Integrity verification (checks critical files)
   - Self-contained updater (no manual file copying)

4. **Machine-Readable JSON Export**
   - JSON schema: `config/sessions-data-schema.json`
   - Export script: `scripts/export-sessions-json.sh`
   - Structured session history for multi-agent workflows
   - Mirrors SESSIONS.md with: mental models, decision rationale, problem-solving approaches
   - Enables external tooling, analytics, automation, QA systems
   - Auto-generated by `/save-context` (Step 7.5)
   - Bundled by `/export-context` with Markdown

**New Core File:**
- **DECISIONS.md** - Decision log with WHY, alternatives considered, tradeoffs accepted
  - Critical for AI agents to understand rationale
  - Includes "Guidelines for AI Agents" section
  - Template with comprehensive example decision
  - Active/Superseded decisions tables

**Enhanced Templates:**
- **SESSIONS.template.md** - Now structured BUT comprehensive (40-60 lines)
  - Added "Problem Solved" section (issue, constraints, approach, rationale)
  - Added "Mental Models" section (current understanding, key insights, gotchas)
  - Added "TodoWrite State" capture
  - "Why this approach" rationale throughout
  - Guidelines emphasize AI agent needs

- **QUICK_REF.template.md** - Auto-generated dashboard
  - Project status at-a-glance
  - Tech stack, URLs, current focus
  - Context navigation links
  - Generated by /save-context

- **DECISIONS.template.md** - Comprehensive decision log format
  - Context, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives, Tradeoffs
  - "When to Reconsider" triggers
  - "For AI agents" guidance section

**Updated Commands:**
- **/init-context** - Now creates 3 core files (added DECISIONS.md)
  - Explains dual-purpose philosophy
  - Emphasizes AI agent review/takeover use case

- **/save-context** - Enhanced for dual purpose
  - Captures TodoWrite state + mental models
  - Creates comprehensive SESSIONS.md entries (40-60 lines)
  - Updates DECISIONS.md when significant decisions made
  - Auto-generates QUICK_REF.md dashboard
  - **NEW:** Optional helper script (Step 2 - Option A)
  - **NEW:** Exports JSON (Step 7.5) for multi-agent workflows
  - Structured but comprehensive for AI understanding

- **/export-context** - Now bundles both Markdown and JSON
  - Creates timestamped export directory (not single file)
  - Exports sessions-data.json alongside README.md
  - Includes context-config.json for reference
  - Perfect for multi-agent handoffs and external tooling
  - Updated reporting to show both formats

- **/update-context-system** - Simplified using install.sh
  - Now downloads and runs install.sh script
  - Reduced from 892 lines to 289 lines
  - Handles all updates automatically
  - Version checking and backups built-in

**Deleted Commands:**
- Removed /init-context-full (no longer needed)
- Removed /quick-save-context (merged into smart /save-context)

### Changed

**Philosophy Shift:**
```
OLD (v1.7.0): "Start minimal → Grow naturally when complexity demands"
NEW (v1.8.0): "Minimal overhead during work → Rich context for AI review/takeover"
```

**The Key Insight:**
User feedback was evaluating ONLY for session continuity, missing the primary value: enabling AI agents to understand your thinking and take over development with full context.

**File Structure:**
- **3 core files** (was 2 in v1.7.0): CONTEXT.md, STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md
- **Structured but comprehensive** - AI agents need depth, not just brevity
- **SESSIONS.md 40-60 lines** (not 10-20 minimal OR 190+ exhausting)

**Documentation Updates:**
- README.md - Added "Dual Purpose" philosophy throughout
- PRD.md - Added AI Agent as secondary user persona
- PRD.md - Comprehensive v1.8.0 philosophy shift section
- All commands reference AI agent needs

**Core Principles:**
- **Within sessions:** TodoWrite for productivity (minimal overhead)
- **At save points:** Rich documentation for AI review/takeover
- **Single source of truth:** No duplication, but comprehensive depth
- **Mental models captured:** AI understands thinking, not just code
- **Decision rationale preserved:** AI knows WHY, not just WHAT

### Why This Matters

**For AI Code Reviews:**
- AI agents understand constraints and tradeoffs
- Reviews have full context, not superficial
- AI won't suggest already-rejected alternatives

**For AI Takeover:**
- AI agents can seamlessly continue development
- Mental models preserved - AI knows your approach
- Decision history prevents contradicting prior choices

**For Introspection:**
- Step back and review your own thinking
- Comprehensive documentation enables self-review
- Architecture and decision reviews with full context

### Impact

**Before v1.8.0:**
- Optimized only for session continuity
- Overhead felt high for daily use
- Missing the AI agent use case entirely

**After v1.8.0:**
- Optimized for both developer productivity AND AI agent review/takeover
- Low overhead during work (TodoWrite)
- Rich context at save points (comprehensive docs)
- AI agents can understand, review, and take over with full context

## [1.7.0] - 2025-10-05

### Changed

**Progressive Enhancement (Phase 4) - Real-World Feedback Integration:**

User feedback revealed the comprehensive 8-file approach felt overengineered:
- ✅ SESSIONS.md + CLAUDE.md provided 80% of value
- ❌ Other files felt like "documentation for documentation's sake"
- ❌ 50-step /save-context process felt bureaucratic

**Response: Start Simple, Grow Naturally**

1. **/init-context now minimal by default** (.claude/commands/init-context.md)
   - Creates only 3 core files: CLAUDE.md, SESSIONS.md, tasks/
   - Explains progressive enhancement to users
   - Additional files suggested when complexity demands it
   - 80% of value, 20% of overhead

2. **/init-context-full added for comprehensive mode** (.claude/commands/init-context-full.md)
   - Creates all 8 documentation files (old /init-context behavior)
   - Use when complexity is known from day one
   - Most projects should start with /init-context instead

3. **/save-context now intelligent** (.claude/commands/save-context.md)
   - **Updates only what changed**, not everything
   - Suggests creating new files when complexity demands it
   - Focus on "write good session summary" not "follow 50 steps"
   - No bureaucratic process - just smart documentation

4. **save-context-guide.md repositioned as reference** (.claude/docs/save-context-guide.md)
   - Added header: "This is a reference guide, not a checklist"
   - Explains v1.7.0 philosophy: "Write a good session summary. Update what matters."
   - Guidance when needed, not process to execute rigidly

5. **Documentation updates**
   - README.md: Progressive enhancement philosophy, new tagline
   - SETUP_GUIDE.md: Updated for minimal/full modes
   - PRD.md: v1.7.0 philosophy shift section
   - All version references: 1.6.2 → 1.7.0

### Added

- `/init-context-full` command for comprehensive 8-file setup
- On-demand file creation logic in /save-context:
  - ARCHITECTURE.md → When 20+ files, 5+ directories
  - DECISIONS.md → When 3+ technical decisions made
  - CODE_STYLE.md → When standards mentioned multiple times
  - KNOWN_ISSUES.md → When tracking 3+ bugs
  - PRD.md → When product scope expanding
- Progressive enhancement explanation in /init-context output

### Philosophy

**What Changed:**
```
OLD (v1.6.2): Create comprehensive system → Force all projects to use it
NEW (v1.7.0): Start minimal → Grow naturally when complexity demands it
```

**Core Learning:**
Real-world usage validated the concept (session continuity, WIP capture, preferences) but showed execution was overengineered. v1.7.0 keeps what worked while removing overhead.

**80/20 Principle:**
- 80% of value came from SESSIONS.md + CLAUDE.md
- Other files useful when needed, overhead when not
- Let complexity emerge naturally, don't impose it

### Impact

**Before Phase 4:**
- New projects got 8 files whether needed or not
- /save-context updated everything every time
- Process felt bureaucratic
- "Documentation for documentation's sake"

**After Phase 4:**
- New projects start minimal (3 files)
- Additional docs suggested when helpful
- /save-context intelligent (updates what changed)
- "Document what matters"

**Quality:** Architecture improved based on real-world validation
**User Experience:** Dramatically simplified without losing value
**Philosophy:** Progressive enhancement over comprehensive upfront

## [1.6.2] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed

**Improvements from External Code Review (Phase 3.6):**

External AI review of migration practice project identified several improvements:

1. **Config Version Mismatch** (.claude/commands/migrate-context.md)
   - **Bug:** /migrate-context created config with "version": "1.0.0"
   - **Impact:** /update-context-system couldn't detect upgrades (version always old)
   - **Fix:** Changed to "version": "1.6.2" (matches current toolkit)
   - **Line changed:** migrate-context.md:388

2. **.claude Directory Placement Documentation** (.claude/commands/migrate-context.md)
   - **Gap:** No clear warning about .claude needing to be IN project root (not parent)
   - **Impact:** Practice project had .claude in parent → commands didn't load
   - **Fix:** Added visual diagrams showing correct vs wrong structure
   - **Added:** Step 0 now checks if .claude exists in current directory
   - **Lines changed:** migrate-context.md:35-107

3. **Code Review TypeScript Verification** (.claude/commands/code-review.md)
   - **Bug:** Review claimed strict mode missing when it was actually enabled
   - **Root Cause:** Didn't read tsconfig.json, just assumed/guessed
   - **Impact:** False positive issues, wasted developer time
   - **Fix:** Added explicit TypeScript Configuration review category
   - **Added:** "ACTION: Read tsconfig.json to verify settings" with strict mode checks
   - **Lines changed:** code-review.md:147-153

### Impact

**Before Phase 3.6:**
- Migrations created outdated config versions
- .claude placement issues not clearly documented
- Code reviews could claim false positives

**After Phase 3.6:**
- Migrations create current version configs
- Clear visual guidance for .claude placement
- Code reviews verify TypeScript settings before claiming issues

**Quality:** All improvements based on real-world migration testing
**Credit:** Bug reports from external AI code review

## [1.6.1] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed

**Critical Bug Fixes (Phase 3.5):**

External code review identified several critical bugs that could break installations:

1. **Quick Start Instructions (README.md, SETUP_GUIDE.md)**
   - **Bug:** Only instructed copying `.claude/commands/`, missing `.claude/docs/`, `.claude/checklists/`, and `scripts/`
   - **Impact:** Commands referenced missing files, /validate-context failed immediately, documentation links broken
   - **Fix:** Updated to copy entire `.claude/` directory and `scripts/` folder
   - **Lines changed:** README.md:47-48, SETUP_GUIDE.md:30-39

2. **Missing Documentation Tree (README.md)**
   - **Bug:** "What Gets Created" tree omitted `.context-config.json` and `artifacts/` directories
   - **Impact:** Users didn't know what would be created, might delete artifact directories
   - **Fix:** Expanded tree to show toolkit structure, config file, and all artifact subdirectories
   - **Lines changed:** README.md:65-92

3. **Update Command Curl Failure (update-context-system.md)**
   - **Bug:** No error handling on `curl` download - would proceed with empty zip
   - **Impact:** Failed download would delete all commands, bricking the installation
   - **Fix:** Added `curl -f` flag and explicit download verification before proceeding
   - **Lines changed:** .claude/commands/update-context-system.md:125-134

4. **Update Command Directory Bug (update-context-system.md)**
   - **Bug:** Used `cd -` to return to project root (only works if previous command changed dirs)
   - **Impact:** Updates ran in wrong directory, files not updated or wrong paths modified
   - **Fix:** Capture `PROJECT_ROOT=$(pwd)` before work, use absolute paths, deterministic cd
   - **Lines changed:** .claude/commands/update-context-system.md:179-189

5. **Validation Subshell Bug (scripts/validate-context.sh)**
   - **Bug:** `INVALID_SESSIONS` counter incremented in pipeline subshell, stayed zero
   - **Impact:** Corrupted session JSON files passed validation with false "✅" report
   - **Fix:** Use process substitution (`< <(echo ...)`) to preserve shell state
   - **Lines changed:** scripts/validate-context.sh:149-155

6. **Missing Command Validation (scripts/validate-context.sh)**
   - **Bug:** Only checked 4 of 9 commands (missing 5 newer commands)
   - **Impact:** Missing or renamed commands slipped through validation
   - **Fix:** Extended COMMANDS array to all 9 commands
   - **Lines changed:** scripts/validate-context.sh:219-229

7. **Documentation Mismatch (validate-context.md)**
   - **Bug:** Command doc promised section-level validation and task completeness checks not implemented
   - **Impact:** Users expected deeper guarantees than received, reduced trust
   - **Fix:** Aligned documentation with actual script capabilities
   - **Lines changed:** .claude/commands/validate-context.md:23-51

### Impact

**Before Phase 3.5:**
- New installations started broken (missing dependencies)
- Update command could brick installations
- Validation had silent failures
- Documentation misleading

**After Phase 3.5:**
- Clean installations work immediately
- Update command safe with error handling
- Validation catches all issues
- Documentation accurate

**Security:** Prevented potential data loss from failed updates
**Reliability:** All critical paths now validated and error-handled
**User Experience:** First-time setup now works correctly

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-04

### Removed
- **JSON artifacts feature** - Removed abandoned state.json/session-N.json generation
  - Deleted Step 5.5 from save-context.md (193 lines)
  - Moved state-schema.json and session-schema.json to reference/archive/abandoned-features/
  - Feature was never consumed by review-context, added complexity without value
- **Redundant reference/ files** - Deleted 4 obsolete files consolidated into templates
  - communication-guide.md → Merged into CLAUDE.template.md
  - workflow-rules.md → Merged into CODE_STYLE.template.md
  - claude-example.md → Redundant with templates
  - helpful prompts.txt → Obsolete notes

### Changed
- **validate-context.md streamlined** - 612 lines → 240 lines (60% reduction)
  - Now calls scripts/validate-context.sh instead of duplicating logic
  - Eliminated 372 lines of duplicate validation code
  - Command focuses on interpretation, script does the work
- **preferences.yaml repurposed** - Moved to reference/preference-catalog.yaml
  - Clearly marked as reference documentation, not enforced
  - Actual preferences live in CLAUDE.template.md, CODE_STYLE.template.md, .context-config.json
- **Reference folder reorganized** - Better structure for archived content
  - Created reference/archive/ for historical approaches
  - Created reference/archive/old-prompts/ for superseded prompts

  - No longer warns about missing state-schema.json or session-schema.json
  - Updated to check for preference-catalog.yaml in reference/ (informational only)
- **STRUCTURE.md** - Updated to reflect current file organization
  - Removed references to deleted JSON schemas
  - Added reference/ section
  - Clarified preference-catalog.yaml purpose

### Technical Details

**Phase 1 Cleanup Complete:**

This release implements Phase 1 of the comprehensive system review. Main goals:
1. Remove abandoned features (JSON artifacts)
2. Delete redundant files (reference/ cleanup)
3. Consolidate duplicate logic (validation)
4. Simplify commands (validate-context)

**Lines Removed:**
- save-context.md: -193 lines (JSON artifact generation)
- validate-context.md: -372 lines (duplicate validation logic)
- Total: ~565 lines removed

**Files Removed:**
- 4 redundant reference files (consolidated into templates)
- 2 JSON schema files (abandoned feature)
- Old validate-context.md (archived)

**Files Reorganized:**
- preferences.yaml → reference/preference-catalog.yaml
- Legacy files → reference/archive/
- Old prompts → reference/archive/old-prompts/

**Impact:**
- ✅ Simpler system (fewer failure points)
- ✅ No broken promises (JSON artifacts removed)
- ✅ No duplicate logic (validation consolidated)
- ✅ Clear file organization (reference/ structure)
- ✅ Honest about what's enforced (preferences are catalog only)

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 2: Extract documentation from commands
- Phase 3: Simplify /update-context-system Step 4

## [1.3.4] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- **Documentation metadata drift** - All docs now show consistent v1.3.4
- **README.md version conflict** - Line 378 now matches line 3 (was 1.0.0 vs 1.3.3)
- **PRD.md outdated info** - Version, status, and command catalog updated
- **STRUCTURE.md incomplete listings** - All 9 commands and config files documented
- **SETUP_GUIDE.md config location** - Clarified context/.context-config.json (not root)
- **init-context.md hardcoded config** - Now downloads latest template from GitHub
- **CHANGELOG.md version history** - Added all versions from 1.1.0 to 1.3.3

### Changed
- **README.md:** Version 1.0.0 → 1.3.4, Status "Implementation Phase" → "Active Development"
- **PRD.md:** Command catalog expanded from 4 to 9 commands with categories
- **STRUCTURE.md:** Complete command listing and config directory documentation
- **SETUP_GUIDE.md:** Removed manual config copy (init-context creates it automatically)
- **.claude/commands/init-context.md:** Step 5 now uses curl to fetch template, Edit tool for placeholders

### Technical Details
This was a pure documentation consistency update addressing external code review feedback. No functional changes to commands or templates.

**Issues Fixed:**
1. Version conflicts (1.3.3 vs 1.0.0 in README)
2. Command catalogs showing 4 instead of 9
3. Config location inconsistencies
4. Outdated hardcoded config stubs
5. Incomplete version history

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- **/migrate-context now moves ALL files** - Hybrid approach catches edge cases
- CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md and similar variants now moved correctly
- ALL task markdown files now moved (not just todo.md and next-steps.md)

### Changed
- **Hybrid file moving strategy in /migrate-context Step 3:**
  - Core docs: Explicit list (CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, etc.) for clear audit trail
  - Deployment variants: Pattern matching (`*DEPLOYMENT.md`) catches CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md, etc.
  - Task files: Comprehensive wildcard (`tasks/*.md`) moves ALL markdown files from tasks/
- More robust migration that handles different project structures

### Technical Details
**Old approach (v1.3.2):**
```bash
mv DEPLOYMENT.md context/
mv tasks/next-steps.md context/tasks/
mv tasks/todo.md context/tasks/
```
- Missed CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md (wasn't in list)
- Missed roadmap-brainstorm.md (only moved specific task files)

**New approach (v1.3.3):**
```bash
mv DEPLOYMENT.md context/
mv *DEPLOYMENT.md context/  # Catches any variant
mv tasks/*.md context/tasks/  # Catches ALL task files
```

### Impact
- ✅ No more missed files during migration
- ✅ Handles CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md and other deployment variants
- ✅ Moves ALL task files (roadmap-brainstorm.md, planning.md, etc.)
- ✅ Future-proof for new file types in tasks/
- ✅ Maintains explicit control over core docs

### User Feedback
User tested v1.3.2 migration and found CLOUDFLARE_DEPLOYMENT.md and roadmap-brainstorm.md weren't moved. This release uses a hybrid approach (explicit + wildcards) to catch all edge cases while maintaining clarity.

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- **Cleanup step for /init-context** - Step 6 removes installation files after initialization
- **Cleanup step for /migrate-context** - Step 9 removes installation files after migration
- Automatic removal of `claude-context-system/` directory
- Automatic removal of `claude-context-system.zip` (if exists)

### Changed
- Both /init-context and /migrate-context now clean up after themselves
- Projects are left clean without installation artifacts
- Matches cleanup behavior from /update-context-system

### Impact
- ✅ No more leftover installation directories after init/migration
- ✅ Cleaner project structure
- ✅ Consistent cleanup across all commands
- ✅ User doesn't need to manually remove installation files

### User Request
User noticed that post-migration, the `claude-context-system` folder remained in the parent directory. This release ensures both /init-context and /migrate-context clean up installation files, just like /update-context-system does.

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- **Consistency issue in /migrate-context** - Updated Core Development Methodology section to match template
- Old single-line debugging guidance replaced with 6-bullet detailed version
- Added 10-step development methodology to migration augmentation

### Changed
- /migrate-context now adds the same improved guidance that's in CLAUDE.template.md
- Ensures migrated projects get latest best practices immediately
- No need to run /update-context-system right after migration

### Impact
- ✅ New migrations get latest debugging guidance automatically
- ✅ Consistency between /init-context, /migrate-context, and templates
- ✅ Better first-time migration experience

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- **General-purpose template synchronization system** - Step 4 now compares ALL sections in ALL template files
- Section-by-section comparison for CLAUDE.template.md, CODE_STYLE.template.md, ARCHITECTURE.template.md
- Detects three states: identical (skip), different (ask user), missing (ask user)
- Explicit blacklist for project-specific sections that should never be updated
- Support for adding missing system sections from templates

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Step 4 completely redesigned from content-block detection to full section scanning
- Now uses marker format: `SECTION_CHANGED|<filename>|<section name>` and `SECTION_MISSING|<filename>|<section name>`
- Claude processes each section update individually with user approval
- Always asks user for approval - never auto-applies changes (safety first)

### Technical Details
- **Philosophy:** Check every section, ask about every change, preserve all project-specific content
- **Blacklist approach:** Explicitly list sections to never touch (Project Overview, Architecture, etc.)
- **Template files checked:**
  1. CLAUDE.template.md → context/CLAUDE.md
  2. CODE_STYLE.template.md → context/CODE_STYLE.md (if exists)
  3. ARCHITECTURE.template.md → context/ARCHITECTURE.md (if exists)
- **Process:**
  1. Extract all `##` sections from template
  2. Skip blacklisted (project-specific) sections
  3. For each remaining section: check if exists, compare content, output marker if different/missing
  4. Claude reads markers and asks user approval for each one
  5. Apply updates while preserving project structure

### Impact
- **ANY template improvement is now detected** - not limited to specific hard-coded blocks ✅
- Works across all template files, not just CLAUDE.md
- No need to update the command when templates improve
- True general-purpose update system
- User has full control - approves each change individually

### User Request
User identified the fundamental requirement: "we should redesign step 4 to check all blocks that exist in the template files against the project files. so every section in every template file should be checked."

This release fully implements that vision.

## [1.2.9] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Section structure mismatch** - Step 4 now detects updates even when projects have restructured sections
- Debugging guidance updates weren't detected when "Core Development Methodology" was promoted to top-level section
- Changed from section-based comparison to content-block comparison

### Changed
- Step 4 completely rewritten to use content-block detection instead of full section extraction
- Now extracts specific blocks like "**When Debugging:**" regardless of section hierarchy
- Handles migrated projects that promoted `### Core Development Methodology` to `## Core Development Methodology`

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause:** Projects migrated with /migrate-context sometimes restructure sections
  - Template has: `## Working with You` > `### Core Development Methodology` > `**When Debugging:**`
  - Migrated project had: `## Working with You` AND separate `## Core Development Methodology`
  - Section extraction stopped at next `##`, missing the debugging content entirely
- **Solution:** Extract specific content blocks (e.g., debugging guidance) directly
  - Uses awk pattern matching on `**When Debugging:**` marker
  - Compares actual content, not section structure
  - Works regardless of section hierarchy differences

### Impact
- **Debugging updates will finally be detected** in migrated projects ✅
- Step 4 now robust to section restructuring
- Updates preserve project's chosen structure while updating content

### User Report
User found Step 4 reported "No template updates needed" even though debugging guidance differed:
- Template had 6-bullet debugging steps
- Project had single-line version
- Caused by section structure mismatch preventing content comparison

## [1.2.8] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: awk syntax error** - Fixed boolean comparisons that caused "illegal statement" errors
- **CRITICAL: Section extraction** - Now stops at next `##` header correctly (was grabbing too many sections)
- Changed from `!found` to `found == 0` (awk syntax requirement)
- Changed from `found` to `found == 1` for consistency

### Changed
- Made "ask user" instruction absolutely mandatory with explicit warnings
- Added "CRITICAL: You MUST ask the user for approval. Do NOT make the decision yourself"
- Added working directory rules to prevent path escaping errors
- Explicit instruction: "Do NOT try to cd into the project directory yourself"

### Impact
- **No more awk syntax errors during execution** ✅
- **Extracts only the target section** (e.g., just "Working with You", not everything until "Commands")
- **Claude will always ask user** instead of deciding "it's too different" and skipping
- **Cleaner execution** with fewer parse errors

### User Feedback
User reported:
1. "awk syntax errors" during execution
2. "(eval):1: parse error near `)'" errors at start
3. Claude made decision not to apply update without asking
4. Section extraction grabbed too much content (102 lines vs 48 lines expected)

All issues addressed in this release.

## [1.2.7] - 2025-10-04

### Changed
- **COMPLETE REDESIGN: Step 4 is now general-purpose** - No longer hard-coded to specific blocks
- Step 4 now compares entire system sections (like "Working with You")
- Detects ANY change to template guidance, not just "When Debugging:" or config reference
- Uses awk-based section extraction that handles both `##` and `###` headers flexibly

### Added
- Unified diff output showing all changes in context
- Section-level comparison instead of block-level
- Support for "Working with Rex" or "Working with You" variations

### Fixed
- Hard-coded block detection that missed other template improvements
- Limited to only 2 specific markers (DEBUGGING_BLOCK_UPDATED, CONFIG_REF_UPDATED)
- Template changes outside those blocks were never detected

### How It Works Now
1. Extract entire "Working with You" section from template (all subsections included)
2. Extract same from project's CLAUDE.md
3. Run diff to detect ANY differences
4. Show unified diff with full context
5. Ask user to review and approve
6. Replace entire section if approved

### Impact
- **Any** future improvement to CLAUDE.template.md will be detected
- No need to update Step 4 command when adding new guidance
- True general-purpose template update system
- User sees full context of what's changing

### User Request
User identified the fundamental flaw: "Right now it seems like updating the debug information is hard coded into step 4, but the goal isn't just to update the debugging code, update should be general purpose. whenever we make a change to claude.template.md (or any of the other template files) the /update-context-system command should try to integrate those changes"

This release addresses that request completely.

## [1.2.6] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Cleanup step order** - Moved cleanup from Step 9 to Step 10 (final step)
- Cleanup was deleting /tmp/claude-context-update BEFORE Step 4 could access templates
- This is why template updates were never detected or applied in v1.2.5 and earlier
- Step 4 explicitly instructs Claude to EXECUTE Edit tool, not just describe it

### Changed
- Step 9: Generate Update Report (moved from Step 10)
- Step 10: Cleanup (moved from Step 9, now runs LAST)
- Step 4: Added explicit ACTION instructions to read CLAUDE.md and use Edit tool when updates detected
- Step 4: Changed from passive "should do" to active "MUST take these actions immediately"

### Root Cause Analysis
**Why template updates never worked:**
1. Step 3: Downloaded templates to /tmp/claude-context-update ✅
2. Step 9: Deleted /tmp/claude-context-update ❌ (TOO EARLY)
3. Step 4: Tried to cd /tmp/claude-context-update → directory not found
4. Bash script couldn't run, no updates detected
5. CLAUDE.md never updated with template improvements

**Fixed in v1.2.6:**
- Cleanup runs LAST (Step 10)
- Step 4 can access /tmp/claude-context-update successfully
- Template detection works correctly
- Edit tool explicitly executed when updates found

### Impact
- Template improvements (like v1.2.2 debugging guidance) will now be detected and applied
- Users will actually receive system updates via /update-context-system
- Self-updating command now fully functional

## [1.2.5] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- **Step 1 shell parsing error** - Split complex single-command script into 3 separate steps
- Removed `cd` command in middle of script that caused eval parse errors
- Now uses absolute paths (`/tmp/claude-context-update/latest.zip`) instead of relative paths

### Changed
- Step 1 split into Step 1a (get current version), Step 1b (download), Step 1c (compare)
- Each step is a separate bash command - more reliable execution
- Clearer output showing which step is executing

### Technical Details
- Old: Single bash script with embedded `cd` caused: `(eval):1: parse error near )`
- New: Three separate commands, no directory changes, absolute paths throughout
- Variables still preserved across steps (CURRENT_VERSION, LATEST_VERSION)

## [1.2.4] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- **Step 3.5: Self-Reload** - Command now reloads itself mid-execution after downloading updates
- Instructs Claude to read the newly updated command file before continuing to Step 4
- Ensures latest Step 4 logic is used immediately (no need for second run)

### Fixed
- Bootstrapping problem where /update-context-system would execute old Step 4 logic even after downloading new version
- Previously required two runs: first to download, second to execute new logic
- Now works correctly in single run

### Changed
- After Step 3 (copy commands), explicitly read .claude/commands/update-context-system.md
- Compare newly read Step 4 with original instructions
- Switch to new instructions if different

### Impact
- v1.2.3 Step 4 fix now works on first run (previously needed two runs)
- Any future Step 4 improvements take effect immediately
- True self-updating command behavior

## [1.2.3] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX:** Step 4 template detection now works correctly
- Rewrote Step 4 to use content-based detection instead of section-based
- Now searches for specific markers like `**When Debugging:**` regardless of section structure
- Works for both new projects and migrated projects with different section organization
- Detects template improvements that were previously missed

### Changed
- Step 4 now uses grep to extract specific content blocks (e.g., "When Debugging" guidance)
- Compares blocks directly, not entire sections
- More surgical updates that preserve project-specific customizations

### Technical Details
- Old approach: `sed -n '/^## Section/,/^## /p'` - failed when section was `###` instead of `##`
- New approach: `grep -A N '^**Marker:**'` - works regardless of section level
- Handles migrated projects that restructured sections (e.g., "## Core Development Methodology" vs "### Core Development Methodology")

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-04

### Changed
- Fixed config reference in CLAUDE.template.md (config/preferences.yaml → context/.context-config.json)
- Enhanced debugging guidance with detailed bullet points instead of single line
- Improved "No Lazy Coding" principle wording for clarity

### Improved
- **Working with You section:**
  - Now references correct config location
  - Expanded debugging section with 6 specific steps
  - Changed "Find root causes" to "Always look for root causes" for emphasis

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- Step 0 working directory verification in /update-context-system
- Checks for context/.context-config.json before proceeding
- Detects if running from parent folder and suggests cd command
- Clear error messages with pwd output

### Fixed
- Error when running /update-context-system from parent folder instead of project folder
- Claude saying "file access issues" when really in wrong directory
- Confusing error messages that didn't explain the root cause

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-04

### Changed
- **BREAKING IMPROVEMENT:** Rewrote Step 4 of /update-context-system to be general-purpose
- Now uses diff-based approach to detect ANY content changes in system sections
- Compares template sections to current sections using sed + diff
- Shows unified diff of changes before applying
- Works for all future template updates, not just "Rex" references

### Added
- Extract and compare mechanism for system sections
- Interactive diff review with unified output
- Support for detecting renamed sections (e.g., "Working with Rex" → "Working with You")
- Clear distinction between system sections (updatable) and project sections (never touch)

### Improved
- Step 4 now catches wording improvements, restructured content, new best practices
- More maintainable - no hard-coded text replacements
- Better user experience - see exactly what will change

## [1.1.4] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- Step 4 in /update-context-system to detect and update personal references
- Checks for "Rex" references in CLAUDE.md and CODE_STYLE.md
- Offers to update "Working with Rex" → "Working with You"
- Offers to update "What Rex Prefers" → "What You Prefer"
- Interactive confirmation before applying changes

### Fixed
- Personal references not being updated when system was made universal
- Migrated projects keeping old "Rex" references after update
- Gap where /migrate-context preserves content but /update-context-system doesn't modernize it

## [1.1.3] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- Multiple .claude directory detection in /init-context and /migrate-context
- Warning message when parent folders have .claude directories
- Step 0 verification in both commands to check working directory
- Documentation in VERSION_MANAGEMENT.md about .claude conflicts
- Troubleshooting section in README.md for .claude directory issues

### Fixed
- Critical issue where nested projects load commands from parent .claude folder
- Commands appearing out of sync or missing after updates
- Confusing behavior when test/example projects are nested

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- Added explicit ACTION instructions to /update-context-system
- Consolidated Steps 1-2 into single bash script to preserve variables
- Added "Use the Bash tool" instructions throughout command
- Simplified command execution with clear "STOP_NO_UPDATE" / "PROCEED_WITH_UPDATE" markers
- Now actually executes bash commands instead of just describing them

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-04

### Fixed
- Improved version detection in /update-context-system
- Added explicit bash commands for version extraction using grep + sed
- Added clear exit logic when versions match (exit 0)
- Now properly detects version differences and only updates when needed

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-04

### Added
- CHANGELOG.md to track version history
- .gitignore template for context system files
- Session number auto-increment in /save-context
- /quick-save-context command for lightweight checkpoints
- Project type presets in /init-context
- /export-context command to generate combined markdown
- /validate-context command for template validation
- Conflict detection in /update-context-system

### Changed
- Made system universal by removing personal name references
- "Working with Rex" → "Working with You" in all templates
- Added cleanup instructions after installation
