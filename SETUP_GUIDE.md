# Claude Context System - Setup Guide

**Version 2.0.0** - Single Source of Truth

> **What's New in v2.0:** New file structure (CONTEXT.md, STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md, SESSIONS.md, QUICK_REF.md) eliminates status duplication. See [v2.0 Overview](#whats-new-in-v20) below.

## Which Setup Command Do I Use?

### Use `/init-context` for:
- ✅ **New projects** with no documentation yet (RECOMMENDED)
- ✅ Fresh scaffolded projects (npx create-next-app, etc.)
- ✅ Creates 5 core files: CONTEXT.md, STATUS.md, DECISIONS.md, SESSIONS.md, QUICK_REF.md
- ✅ Optional files (PRD, ARCHITECTURE) suggested when complexity demands

### Use `/migrate-context` for:
- ✅ **Existing projects** with v1.x documentation (pre-v2.0)
- ✅ Projects with CLAUDE.md, next-steps.md, todo.md in context/
- ✅ Projects with scattered artifacts (lighthouse reports, code reviews)
- ✅ Want to preserve ALL existing content while adopting v2.0 structure
- ⚠️ **Note:** Automated migration coming in v2.1 - currently manual (see [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md))

---

## Quick Start (New Project)

### Step 1: Get the Toolkit
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system.git

# Or download just the .claude/commands folder from GitHub
```

### Step 2: Copy Toolkit to Your Project
```bash
# From your new project root
cp -r claude-context-system/.claude .
cp -r claude-context-system/scripts .
```

This copies:
- `.claude/commands/` - All 9 slash commands
- `.claude/docs/` - Comprehensive guides (referenced by commands)
- `.claude/checklists/` - Review criteria (used by /code-review)
- `scripts/validate-context.sh` - Validation script (used by /validate-context)

### Step 3: Initialize Context
```
/init-context
```
This creates 5 core files in `context/`:
- **CONTEXT.md** - Project orientation (who/what/how/why)
- **STATUS.md** - Current state (tasks/blockers/next steps) - **single source of truth**
- **DECISIONS.md** - Decision log (WHY choices were made)
- **SESSIONS.md** - History (structured, scannable format)
- **QUICK_REF.md** - Auto-generated dashboard

Plus:
- `context/.context-config.json` with your preferences
- `artifacts/` folders for code reviews, reports

**Note:** `/init-context` automatically creates the config file, so you don't need to copy it manually.

### Step 4: Clean Up
```bash
# After /init-context completes successfully, clean up the clone
rm -rf claude-context-system
```

The system is now installed and the clone is no longer needed. Future updates use `/update-context-system` which downloads fresh from GitHub.

### Step 5: Start Working

**v2.0 Two-Tier Workflow:**

```bash
# At session start:
/review-context  # Load context, verify accuracy

# During work:
# Use TodoWrite for active task tracking (minimal overhead)

# At session end (most sessions):
/save            # 2-3 min: Updates STATUS.md, QUICK_REF.md

# Before breaks/handoffs (occasionally):
/save-full       # 10-15 min: Everything /save does + comprehensive SESSIONS.md entry
```

**Time Investment (20 sessions):**
- 17× `/save`: ~40-50 min
- 3× `/save-full`: ~30-45 min
- **Total: ~70-95 min** (50% reduction from v1.x)

---

## Quick Start (Existing Project with Docs)

### Step 1: Get the Toolkit
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system.git

# Or download just the .claude/commands folder from GitHub
```

### Step 2: Copy Commands to Your Project
```bash
# From your existing project root
mkdir -p .claude
cp -r claude-context-system/.claude/commands .claude/
```

### Step 3: Migrate Existing Documentation
```
/migrate-context
```
This will:
- Scan existing docs (CLAUDE.md, PRD.md, etc.)
- Move them to `context/` folder
- Move artifacts (lighthouse reports, code reviews) to `artifacts/`
- Augment existing docs with new sections
- Create missing documentation
- Preserve ALL existing content

### Step 4: Clean Up
```bash
# After /migrate-context completes successfully, clean up the clone
rm -rf claude-context-system
```

The system is now installed and the clone is no longer needed. Future updates use `/update-context-system` which downloads fresh from GitHub.

### Step 5: Verify Migration
```
# Review the migration report
# Check context/ folder structure
# Run save-context to capture current state
/save-context
```

## Command Reference

### `/init-context`
**When:** Once, for NEW projects with no documentation (MINIMAL MODE)

**What it does:**
- Creates `context/` folder structure
- Generates **3 core files** (CLAUDE.md, SESSIONS.md, tasks/)
- Analyzes project and fills in known information
- Creates `.context-config.json`
- Explains progressive enhancement (other files added on-demand)

**Expected output:**
```
✅ Context System Initialized (Minimal Mode)

Created 3 essential files:
- context/CLAUDE.md - Project guide + preferences
- context/SESSIONS.md - Session history
- context/tasks/ - Action tracking

📊 Why only 3 files?
Real-world usage shows SESSIONS.md + CLAUDE.md provide 80% of value.

📈 Growing Your Documentation:
Additional files (PRD.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.) will be suggested
when your project complexity demands it.
```

### `/init-context`

## Troubleshooting

### "Unknown slash command: init-context" (or other commands)
**Cause:** Command files missing `name` field in frontmatter

**Fix:** Ensure each `.md` file in `.claude/commands/` has this format:
```yaml
---
name: command-name
description: Command description
---
```

**Example:**
```yaml
---
name: init-context
description: Initialize Claude Context System for this project
---
```

If you downloaded an older version, the files may only have `description`. Add the `name` field to fix.

### "Commands not recognized"
- Make sure to load commands at session start
- Check `.claude/commands/` folder exists with .md files
- Restart Claude Code conversation to reload commands

### "Context seems stale"
- Run `/save-context` immediately
- Check SESSIONS.md for last update
- Review git log for uncommitted changes

### "Can't resume work"
- Check context/SESSIONS.md for last state
- Review context/tasks/todo.md for WIP
- Look at git status for uncommitted work

### "Documentation drift"
- Run `/save-context` more frequently
- Set reminder to update every hour
- Check .context-config.json settings

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always init on new projects** - Don't skip initialization
2. **Save context before breaks** - Even 5-minute breaks
3. **Review at session start** - Ensure continuity
4. **Don't edit context manually** - Let commands handle it
5. **Include in .gitignore if needed** - `echo "context/" >> .gitignore`
6. **Update config per project** - Some projects need different settings

---

## Customization

### Per-Project Overrides
Edit `.context-config.json`:
- Change documentation location
- Adjust verbosity preferences
- Enable/disable specific docs
- Set custom templates path

### Global Preferences
Keep your master preferences in the cloned repo:
`claude-context-system/config/.context-config.template.json`

### Command Shortcuts
Add to `.context-config.json`:
```json
"aliases": {
  "/s": "/save-context",
  "/r": "/review-context"
}
```

## What's New in v2.0

### Single Source of Truth

**The Problem in v1.x:**
- Status duplicated across CLAUDE.md, next-steps.md, todo.md
- Files drifted out of sync
- Hard to find "current state"

**The v2.0 Solution:**
- **STATUS.md** = single source of truth for current state
- **QUICK_REF.md** = auto-generated dashboard from STATUS.md
- Other files reference STATUS.md instead of duplicating

### New File Structure

| v1.x (Old) | v2.0 (New) | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------|
| CLAUDE.md | **CONTEXT.md** | Project orientation (rarely changes) |
| next-steps.md | **STATUS.md** | Current state (single source of truth) |
| todo.md | (merged into STATUS.md) | Active tasks |
| SESSIONS.md (prose) | **SESSIONS.md** (structured) | History (Changed/Decisions/Files/Next) |
| (missing) | **QUICK_REF.md** | Auto-generated dashboard |
| (missing) | **DECISIONS.md** | Decision log (WHY choices made) |

### Migration Path

**New projects:** Use `/init-context` - creates v2.0 structure automatically

**Existing projects:** See [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for manual migration steps
- Automated migration coming in v2.1
- Manual ensures you understand changes
- Backup included in migration process

### Benefits

1. **No status duplication** - Update once in STATUS.md, done
2. **Scannable history** - SESSIONS.md uses structured format (find info in seconds)
3. **Fast onboarding** - QUICK_REF.md provides instant orientation
4. **Decision tracking** - DECISIONS.md captures WHY for AI agent review
5. **50% time savings** - Two-tier workflow (quick `/save` vs comprehensive `/save-full`)

---

## Questions?

If context seems lost or commands aren't working:
1. Verify `.context-config.json` exists
2. Check `context/` folder has all docs
3. Run `/review-context` for diagnostic
4. Manually tell Claude about your preferences if needed

Remember: The goal is perfect session continuity. When in doubt, `/save-context`!

---

## Advanced Usage

### Using with Git

**Option 1: Track Context (Recommended for solo projects)**
```bash
# Context helps you and future you
git add context/
git commit -m "Update context documentation"
```

**Option 2: Ignore Context (For team projects)**
```bash
# Add to .gitignore
echo "context/" >> .gitignore
echo ".context-config.json" >> .gitignore
```

### Multiple Projects

Keep a master command set:
```bash
# Clone once, then symlink to projects
git clone https://github.com/rexkirshner/claude-context-system.git ~/claude-context-system

# In each project, create symlink instead of copying
mkdir -p .claude
ln -s ~/claude-context-system/.claude/commands .claude/commands
```

### Backup Strategy

Important context should be backed up:
```bash
# Manual backup
cp -r context/ context.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)/

# Or use git (if tracked)
git commit -m "Backup context before major changes"
```

---

## Success Checklist

After setup, verify:
- [ ] `.claude/commands/` folder exists with .md files in project
- [ ] `/init-context` or `/migrate-context` successfully created `context/` folder
- [ ] All 8 core documentation files present in `context/`
- [ ] `artifacts/` subdirectories created (if using /migrate-context)
- [ ] `context/.context-config.json` configured correctly
- [ ] `/review-context` reports "ready to work"
- [ ] Can run `/save-context` without errors

When all checked, you're ready to work with perfect context preservation!
